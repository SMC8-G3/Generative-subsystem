# Generative subsystem outputs
The video file SMC8-G3_video.mp4 gives a brief overview of how the generative subsystem works.

The examples directory contains audio and MIDI sequence examples from the following sources:
* Dataset used to train the neural network models
* Drums RNN test model
* Performance RNN model with default temperature configuration
* Performance RNN model with low temperature configuration
* Transformation module

The transformation directory contains a MATLAB script requiring MIDI Toolbox, and a .mid file used in the script.
